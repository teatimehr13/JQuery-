                Fuck you and your mom and your sister and your job
                And your broke-ass car and that shit you call art
                Fuck you and your friends that I'll never see again
                Everybody but your dog, you can all fuck off
                I swear I meant to mean the best when it ended
                Even tried to bite my tongue when you start shit
                Now you're textin' all my friends asking questions
                They never even liked you in the first place
                Dated a girl that I hate for the attention
                She only made it two days, what a connection
                It's like you'd do anything for my affection
                You're goin' all about it in the worst ways
                I was into you, but I'm over it now
                And I was tryin' to be nice
                But nothing's getting through, so let me spell it out
                A-B-C-D-E, F-U
                And your mom and your sister and your job
                And your broke-ass car and that shit you call art

                Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah
                A-B-C-D-E, F-U
                You said you just needed space and so I gave it
                When I had nothin' to say you couldn't take it
                Told everyone I'm a bitch, so I became it
                Always had to put yourself above me
                I was into you, but I'm over it now
                And I was tryin' to be nice
                But nothing's getting through, so let me spell it out
                A-B-C-D-E, F-U
                And your mom and your sister and your job
                And your craigslist couch and the way your voice sounds
                Fuck you and your friends that I'll never see again
                Everybody but your dog, you can all fuck off
                Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah
                A-B-C-D-E, F-U
                Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah

                Usually I put
                Something on TV
                So we never think
                About you and me
                But today I see
                Our reflections
                Clearly in Hollywood
                Laying on the screen
                You just need a better life than this
                You need something I can never give

                You say something so loving but
                Now I've got to let you go
                You'll be better off in someone new
                I don't wanna be alone
                You know it hurts me too
                You look so broken when you cry
                One more and then I'll say goodbye

                I just wish that I could give you that
                That look that's perfectly un-sad
